# Overview
This was a 96hr long project duing the Wasserstoff Hackathon. Project goals included using technologies learned up until this point and familiarizing myself with documentation for features.
# Requirements
# There are few points that I have taken care of during building this project
All layout and structure should exlainatory names.
All the CSS className are self explainatory.
Folder strucure should be followed properly.
Minimal use of Inline CSS.
Only installed necessary packages and remove unnecessay packages.
Not used any image for implementation of the project.
Last and very important tried to give proper comments to every Section possible.
# Challenges Faced
One of the biggest challenge i have faced with the dataSet, Since team has not provided any dataset to it was bit difficult to search for the proper dataSet that available globally and should mimic the design requirements of the Figma template.
Some part of the design was little bit challenging for me to code in alloted time (but this is why it is hackathon) So, after some research to tackel that I used ant-design library for plots and for map I have used react-simple-map library.
# Approach
First I have completed the folder structure so I can work on predecided path and deleted unnecessary files and folder (created during create-react-app).

Then, Two components navbar and footer I built and pass it to the App.js file.

There was only two page required to build Overview and Dashboard so except these two there was two more pages Statistics and Analytics i have creted a underconstruction message under these two pages (this was not the requiremnt of the project, built for better user Experience).

Under Overview page i have categoried it into Three section [left, right, and bottom] *** i know it is very straight-forward but yes it is straight-forward ***

And like Overview i did same for the Dashboard page two sections [left and right].

For positioning the layout and elements i have used CSS property flex (a lot of CSS work).

So, now you are having all the basic and important info of the project. I hope you will like my project, I know i can do better than this but have tried my best to implement all the feature and functionalities according to the template in this tight time boundation.
